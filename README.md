# [Quiz App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.](https://start.opensourceexams.org/)

### Description

<p>I have adapted this quiz app to be able to use the JSON schema generated by Exam Simulator's Exam creater (https://github.com/exam-simulator).The current loaded JSON quiz is converted from an existing exam practice PDF file. 
  
This Powershell conversion script first converts a PDF to Word, than extracts all the images and saves them separately. Next it extracts all the text paragraph by paragraph, and stores it in a temporary datastructure. Lastly you can export the extracted data to JSON according to the Exam Simulator JSON structure.

If you're interested in this automatic conversion script, let me know ;)</p>
